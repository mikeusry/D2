## Data Sources

### Primary Source: Individual Product Pages
- **Total Product Pages Found:** 30
- **Successfully Extracted:** 28 products
- **Source:** `/product/*` URLs in crawl data

### Secondary Sources (Referenced but not primary):
- Category overview pages (hand-sanitizers, dispensers, etc.)
- Used for category metadata and descriptions

## Extraction Methodology

### Enhanced Parser Approach
Created `/Users/mikeusry/CODING/D2/parse-products-enhanced.js` which:

1. **Targeted Product Pages:** Focused on individual `/product/` URLs for complete data
2. **Intelligent Categorization:** Used keyword detection on product names and descriptions
3. **Data Enrichment:** Extracted prices, images, descriptions from markdown content
4. **Deduplication:** Removed duplicates by slug to ensure unique products
5. **Quality Control:** Filtered out incomplete/malformed entries

### Category Determination Logic
Products categorized based on keywords in name + description:
- **Peracetic Acid:** "paa", "peracetic", "pera fc"
- **Hand Sanitizers:** "hand sanitizer", "e3", "e3 plus"
- **Hand Soaps:** "hand soap", "hand cleaner", "foam soap", "e1", "e2", "e4"
- **Wipes:** "wipe"
- **Dispensers:** "dispenser", "foamer", "attachment", "versaclenz", "dema"
- **Floor/Surface Sanitizers:** "surface sanitizer", "d2 quat", "floor treatment", "footwear"

## Data Quality

### Strengths
- **Complete Coverage:** All 6 categories have products
- **Authentic Data:** Extracted directly from individual product pages
- **Rich Metadata:** Product descriptions, categorizations, URLs
- **Deduplicated:** No duplicate entries

### Limitations
- **Prices:** Most products don't list prices (B2B model - contact for quote)
- **Images:** Some product pages lack image URLs in structured format
- **Descriptions:** Limited to 300 characters (can be extended if needed)
- **Bundles:** Some products are bundles/packages, not individual SKUs

### Missing from Original Crawl
The crawl did not include:
- Product specifications/technical data
- Inventory/stock levels
- Customer reviews
- Pricing tiers or volume discounts
- Related products/accessories

## Notes for Development

3. **Full Descriptions:** Extract complete product descriptions if needed
4. **Related Products:** Cross-reference products within same category
5. **Search/Filter Metadata:** Add tags, keywords for better discoverability
6. **Stock Status:** If applicable, integrate inventory management
