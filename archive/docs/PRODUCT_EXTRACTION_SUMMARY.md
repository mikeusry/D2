## Data Extraction Methodology

### Sources Parsed:
- Hand Sanitizers category page
- Industrial Hand Soap category page
- Floor Sanitizers category page
- Surface Sanitizers category page
- Disinfectant Wipes category page
- Dispensers category page
- Peracetic Acid category page
- Shoe Sanitizer category page

### Extraction Patterns Used:
1. **Products with Prices:** Markdown pattern `![Image](url)\n### Product Name\n$Price`
2. **Products with Links:** Markdown pattern `[![Image](url)](product-link)\n### Product Name`
3. **Deduplication:** Removed 10 duplicate entries based on normalized product names

### Category Mapping Logic:
Products were intelligently categorized using keyword detection:
- **Dispensers/Foamers/Attachments** → Dispensing Options
- **Hand Sanitizers (E3, E3 Plus)** → Hand Sanitizers
- **Hand Soaps (E1, E2, E4, SoftenSure)** → Hand Soaps
- **Wipes** → Food Safe Disinfectant Wipes
- **Surface Sanitizers (D2 variants)** → Floor Sanitizers for Food Service
- **Peracetic Acid products** → Peracetic Acid Products
- **Floor/Shoe/Boot/Footwear products** → Floor Sanitizers for Food Service

## Key Findings

### Complete Product Data (with images and prices):
- 11 products have complete information including prices
- 4 products have images and product URLs but no listed prices

### Missing Product Data:
- **Hand Soaps:** The industrial-hand-soap category page is primarily informational content about hand hygiene best practices. It mentions products like "Alpet E2", "Alpet E1", and "Alpet E4" but does not have structured product listings with images/prices.

- **Peracetic Acid Products:** The peracetic-acid category page is educational content about peracetic acid applications. No specific products are listed in a structured format on this page.

### Category Page Structures:
1. **Product Showcase Pages** (Hand Sanitizers, Dispensers, Surface Sanitizers, Disinfectant Wipes)
   - Feature product cards with images, names, and prices
   - Best source for structured product data

2. **Informational Pages** (Hand Soaps, Floor Sanitizers, Peracetic Acid, Shoe Sanitizers)
   - Focus on education about product categories
   - Product names mentioned in FAQs and text but no structured listings
   - These were intentionally excluded to avoid incomplete/inaccurate data

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths:
- Clean, deduplicated product list
- Accurate categorization using intelligent keyword detection
- All products have valid images and names
- Category metadata includes descriptions and hero images

### Limitations:
- Some products don't have prices listed (likely require quote/contact)
- Hand Soaps and Peracetic Acid categories lack structured product data in the crawl
- Product descriptions and specifications not extracted (not consistently available in category pages)

## Recommendations

To get complete product data for all categories:
1. **Check for dedicated product pages:** Look for URLs like `/product/alpet-e2-hand-soap` in the crawl data
2. **E-commerce integration:** If the site has a shop/cart system, product data may be in API responses
3. **Contact for catalog:** Some B2B sites maintain separate product catalogs with full specifications

## Parser Script

The extraction was performed using `/Users/mikeusry/CODING/D2/parse-products.js`, which:
- Reads the Apify crawl JSON
- Extracts products using multiple regex patterns
- Applies intelligent categorization
- Deduplicates products
- Outputs clean JSON files

To re-run: `cd /Users/mikeusry/CODING/D2 && node parse-products.js`
