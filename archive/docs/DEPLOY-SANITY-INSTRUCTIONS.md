# ðŸš€ Deploy Your Sanity Studio

Your Sanity Studio is configured but needs to be deployed to make it accessible online.

## Quick Deploy (Recommended)

### Option 1: Using the Deploy Script

```bash
./deploy-sanity.sh
```

When prompted:
1. **Select:** "Create new studio hostname" (or select existing if shown)
2. **Enter hostname:** `d2-sanitizers`
3. Wait for deployment (30-60 seconds)

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

```bash
cd studio
npx sanity deploy
```

When prompted:
1. **Enter hostname:** `d2-sanitizers`
2. Confirm deployment
3. Wait for build and upload

---

## After Deployment

Your studio will be available at:
**https://d2-sanitizers.sanity.studio**

### First Time Access:
1. Visit https://d2-sanitizers.sanity.studio
2. Sign in with your Sanity account (the one you used to create the project)
3. You'll see the studio interface with all your schemas ready!

---

## If You Get "Studio not found" Error

This means the deployment hasn't completed yet. To fix:

### Step 1: Verify Project
```bash
cd studio
npx sanity projects list
```

You should see your project: `91lu7dju - D2 Sanitizers`

### Step 2: Deploy with Build
```bash
cd studio
npx sanity deploy
```

Follow the prompts to complete deployment.

### Step 3: Test Local Studio First
```bash
npm run sanity
```

This starts the studio at http://localhost:3333 - verify it works before deploying.

## Alternative: Use Sanity Manage

You can also deploy from the Sanity web interface:

1. Visit https://www.sanity.io/manage/personal/project/91lu7dju
2. Go to "Studio" tab
3. Click "Deploy studio"
4. Follow the prompts

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module" errors
```bash
cd studio
npm install
```

### "Build failed" errors
Check that your schemas are valid:
```bash
cd studio
npx sanity schema validate
```

### "Authentication required" errors
```bash
npx sanity login
```
